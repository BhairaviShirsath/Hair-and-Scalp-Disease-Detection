# Title: Hair and Scalp Disease Detection System using CNN with Appointment Booking Portal

# Description:
The integration of healthcare and technology has significantly advanced medical image analysis, particularly in dermatology. This project introduces an innovative deep learning-based system for detecting hair and scalp diseases. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model accurately identifies dermatological conditions by analyzing medical images.

Our system provides an efficient, non-invasive, and early detection method, enhancing dermatological diagnostics. By leveraging deep learning, the platform enables accessible and timely healthcare solutions. The trained model is seamlessly integrated into a Django-based web application, ensuring ease of use for both healthcare professionals and patients.

This project highlights the impact of AI in healthcare, demonstrating how machine learning-driven applications can revolutionize medical diagnostics. The combination of technology and dermatology paves the way for advanced, patient-centric healthcare solutions.
